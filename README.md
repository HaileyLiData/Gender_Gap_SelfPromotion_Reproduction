# 🌍 Gender Gap in Self-Promotion: Data Reproduction and Analytical Extension

This project reproduces and extends the analysis from the research paper  
**“The Gender Gap in Self-Promotion”** (*Exley & Kessler, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2019*).  
The goal is to understand behavioral differences in how men and women describe their own performance,  
and to explore whether such gaps persist under different model assumptions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Reproduce** the core statistical findings from the original study using regression modeling  
- **Validate** the robustness of gender coefficients under alternative model specifications  
- **Extend** the analysis with new visualizations and contextual interpretations  
- **Reflect** on the behavioral and social implications of self-promotion bias  

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning, standardizing, and encoding categorical variables  
- **Statistical Modeling:** Linear and logistic regression models analyzing performance vs. self-evaluation  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Examining interaction effects between gender, confidence, and context  
- **Visualization:** Distribution plots and marginal effect curves using `ggplot2`  
- **Replication Checks:** Comparing model outputs with results reported in the original study  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- The gender gap in self-promotion remains statistically significant under baseline models  
- When controlling for confidence and task difficulty, the gap decreases but persists  
- Visualization suggests context-dependent moderation rather than a universal difference  
- The replication confirms the main finding: women tend to **understate** performance relative to men

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** tidyverse, broom, ggplot2, dplyr, car  
- **Techniques:** regression analysis, robustness checks, EDA, model interpretation

## 🚀 Future Extensions
- Apply Bayesian hierarchical modeling for subgroup heterogeneity  
- Explore cross-cultural variation in self-promotion behavior  
- Compare predictive vs. explanatory modeling approaches  
- Extend analysis using NLP-based sentiment or linguistic framing measures
